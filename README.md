Piledit is a new video editing software that follows **software engineering** and adopts a **component-oriented approach** in which videos are assembled from small components.  

Also, many video editing software is esoteric and very expensive to learn.

To solve that, Piledit employs a block editor like scratch to make editing video intuitive, even for first-time learners.
