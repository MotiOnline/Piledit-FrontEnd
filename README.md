Piledit is a new video editing software that follows **software engineering** and adopts a **component-oriented approach** in which videos are assembled from small components.  

Also, many video editing software is esoteric and very expensive to learn.

To solve that, Piledit employs a block editor like scratch to make editing video intuitive, even for first-time learners.  

This project is a human resource development program called "SecHack365" sponsored by the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT) and is a [Momiyama](https://www.twitter.com/momeemt) and [Chromeru](https://www.twitter.com/@chromeru0312).  

This is something that is being promoted by.  

This is a front-end repository, powered by **Vue.ts** and **Electron**.
