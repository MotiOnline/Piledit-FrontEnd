Piledit is a new video editing software that follows **software engineering** and adopts a **component-oriented approach** in which videos are assembled from small components.  
Also, many video editing software is esoteric and very expensive to learn. To solve that, Piledit employs a block editor like scratch to make editing video intuitive, even for first-time learners.  
This project is a human resource development program called "SecHack365" sponsored by the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT) and is a @ momeemt and @chromeru0312.
